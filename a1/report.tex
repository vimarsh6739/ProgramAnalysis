    \subsection{Data Race Snippet}
      \Cref{code::11} has a data race in the access of variables \lstinline!reward! and \lstinline!num_workers! in their respective \lstinline!get! and \lstinline!set! methods. \\
      This is also observed in the output screenshot in \Cref{fig::11}.

        \label{fig::11}
      \end{figure}
    
    \subsection{Data Race-free snippet}

      In \Cref{code::12}, the variables \lstinline!reward! and \lstinline!num_workers! are accessed exclusively in a synchronized method. Hence there are no data-races between threads \lstinline!t! and \lstinline!main!. \\
      However even in this case, atomicity of \lstinline!addPushups()! and \lstinline!cheatDay()! is not gauranteed, since reads and writes may be interleaved between both the running threads.\\
      This behaviour can be observed in \Cref{fig::12}.

  \section{Verification of Amdahl's law}
    Amdahl's law states that the total speedup of a program is ultimately decided by the non-parallelizable portion of the porgram. \\
    To verify this, the snippet in \Cref{code::21} performs a modified parallel version of the \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/six-ways-saxpy/}{\textbf{saxpy}} routine and calculates execution time and speedups by varying the number of threads.\\
    The execution time for every thread configuration was taken as the mean of $10$ runs, with all statistics compiled into \textbf{benchmarks.csv}. A plot of the execution speedup w.r.t the mean single threaded computation time is also provided in \Cref{fig::21}.

  \section{Java threads share the heap}
    We show that java threads share the heap using the snippet in \cref{code::31} and it's corresponding output in \cref{code::32}.\\
    Since the list is in heap memory, and all thread names are reflected in it, we can conclude that java threads share the heap.

  \section{Happens Before Relation between statements}
    In this section, the statement at line $i$ is represented as $S_i$. If there is a happens before relation from the action on line $i$ to line $j$, it is represented as $S_i$ HB $S_j$ 
    \subsection{For \textit{datarace.java}}
      For \textit{datarace.java} whose snippet is provided in \Cref{code::11}, we have the following happens-before relations.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main thread:}
          \[
            S47 \rightarrow S48 \rightarrow S49 \rightarrow S36 \rightarrow \mathbf{S38} \rightarrow S39 \rightarrow S40 \rightarrow S23 \rightarrow S9 \rightarrow S24 \rightarrow S12 \rightarrow S25 \rightarrow S10 \rightarrow S26 \rightarrow S13 \rightarrow S41 \rightarrow \mathbf{S42} \rightarrow S50 
          \]
        \item \textbf{Spawned thread:}
          \[
            \mathbf{S38} \rightarrow S31 \rightarrow S32 \rightarrow S16 \rightarrow S9 \rightarrow S17 \rightarrow S12 \rightarrow S18 \rightarrow S10 \rightarrow S19 \rightarrow S13 \rightarrow \mathbf{S42}
            \]
      \end{itemize}
      There are no happens-before relations between the threads, and thus there is a data race in the access of \lstinline!this.reward! and \lstinline!this.num_workers!.

    \subsection{For \textit{dataracefree.java}}
      For \textit{datarace.java} whose snippet is provided in \Cref{code::12}, we have the following happens before relations \textbf{in addition to the ones defined previously}. Note that $S9, S10, S12$ and $S13$ are accessed through a synchronized method lock on the main object in this snippet.

  \section{Deadlocks}
    \subsection{Using synchronized methods}
      I wrote a Java snippet which re-creates the classic Dining Philosopher's deadlock problem, where $5$ philosophers are seated at a table with only $5$ available forks. The code deadlocks when each philosopher picks up exactly $1$ fork for the meal. The snippet is present in \Cref{code::51}. The output of the code is given in the \Cref{fig::51}.

        \caption{Output of code in \Cref{code::51}}
        \label{fig::51}
      \end{figure}

    \subsection{Using a CyclicBarrier}
      The code snippet in \Cref{code::52} spawns $N$ threads which print a message and then synchronize at a barrier. Once the barrier is tripped by the last thread, it is again reset (hence \textbf{cyclic}), and the last thread runs the barrier action.\\
      This barrier action involves spawning a new thread which again awaits at the same barrier(which is reset). Thus we have a cyclic dependency between the post-barrier thread, the cyclic barrier and the last thread, which are all waiting for each other. This leads to a deadlock between the last thread and the post-barrier thread.\\
      A screenshot of the execution is shown in \Cref{fig::52}
